# Convert satellite ID to groundtrack
> by [HULD](https://huld.io)

This is a tool to get the groundtrack from a certain satellite by having as input its satellite ID and the time at which the user wants to know its position. To find the ID of the satellite www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements can be used. The website categorizes the satellites and give their respective TLE.

Example of TLE: 
```
ATLAS CENTAUR 2         
1 00694U 63047A   20090.82980658  .00000230  00000-0  13759-4 0  9990
2 00694  30.3601 323.7151 0585979 224.1186 131.1207 14.02586114825678
```
Its ID is then 00694.

Its groundtrack is calculated from the TLE using the orbit_predictor python libraries. 
## OUTPUT
* format : json
* endpoint: /get/<NORAD_ID>
* exposed via: flask

# Setting the environment
## Requirements
* Docker installed
* Docker compose
## Space-track account
* Create an account for the [space-track](https://www.space-track.org/), credentials put in the SECRET.JSON file.
## Update Secret.json
* See the examples in /secret_sample.json
* Update this file with space-track.org credentials.
* Save it as a secret.json under /code/ directory (i.e /code/secret.json)
## Update Settings.json
* time-resolution [in seconds] - time difference between each set of coordinates that are displayed
* n-points - total number of coordinates generated by a run of the script

## Run following commands
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Connection to the API
```
<docker IP>:5000/get/<NORAD_ID>
```
**On Linux**
```
e.g http://127.0.0.1:5000/get/42790
```
**On Windows** version XP,7,8 (i.e. without shell sub-system)
```
e.g 192.168.99.100:5000/get/42790  #correct IP will be displayed during booting up docker machine
``` 
Will output
```
